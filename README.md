# EPL_2021-2022

## Easiest way to run: 
* Ensure that all the files are in your working directory.
* Open "Run.R" and highlight everything and run it.
* Enjoy  


## If you want to run the files individually, do it in this order:  

Functions first:  
* populate_wins_losses.R
* create_table.R
* simulate_game.R
* simulate_season.R
* simulate_many_seasons.R

Setup workspace:  
* import_SPI.R
* import_scores_and_schedule.R

Create the table:
* set_up_final_table.R

When doing this, make sure you run the variables at the top of "Run.R", as they are used in the other files.
